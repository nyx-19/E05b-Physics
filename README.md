Exploring 2D physics and collisions.

in main.1, I applied a value to gravity so that the balls would fall down and added the acceleration at the end which was the gravity in the y and 0 in the x so the ball would drop directly down.

in main.2, I repeated the steps again from the first main with the gravity and acceleration, but I added in the bounce effect so that it would continue to move even after it's first contact. The instructions asking me to repeat the steps from the first main led me to believe that when you said "bounce off walls" you were only refering to the bottom wall. However, If I wanted the balls to bounce around freely between all four walls, I would just have to set the gravity and acceleration to 0.

in main.3, I set the values of a's x's and y's to c's as well as an aditional t's. This way the they could trade velocities when they bounced off one another and repel.
