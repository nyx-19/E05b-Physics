Exploring 2D physics and collisions.

in main.1, I applied a value to gravity so that the balls would fall down and added the acceleration at the end which was the gravity in the y and 0 in the x so the ball would drop directly down.

in main.2, I repeated the steps again from the first main with the gravity and acceleration, but I changed the x and y values to both be 0 so they would hit against any of the four walls. I then added the -1 bounce effect so that the balls would have movement even after the first contact with a wall. Another solve I considered was only having the ball drop to the ground and bounce, and if I had chosen to do that, I would have just had to put the y values of the acceleration and gravity back to -9.8 like in main.1.

in main.3, I set the values of a's x's and y's to c's as well as an aditional t's. This way the they could trade velocities when they bounced off one another and repel.
